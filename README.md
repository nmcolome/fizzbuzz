Program that prints the numbers from 1 to *n* with the following rules:
* For any number that is a multiple of 3, print 'Fizz'
* For any number that is a multiple of 5, print 'Buzz'
* For any number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print 'FizzBuzz'
* For all other numbers, print the number.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To be able to run the program, you need to have installed: [ruby-2.4.1](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.1/)
